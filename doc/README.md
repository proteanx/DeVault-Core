DeVault Core 4.5.2
=====================

Setup
---------------------
[DeVault Core](http://devault.cc/en/download) is the original DeVault client and it builds the backbone of the network. However, it downloads and stores the entire history of DeVault transactions (which is currently several GBs); depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization process can take anywhere from a few hours to a day or more.

Running
---------------------
The following are some helpful notes on how to run DeVault on your native platform.

### Unix

Unpack the files into a directory and run:

- `bin/devault-qt` (GUI) or
- `bin/devaultd` (headless)

### Windows

Unpack the files into a directory, and then run devault-qt.exe.

### OS X

Drag DeVault-Core to your applications folder, and then run DeVault-Core.
